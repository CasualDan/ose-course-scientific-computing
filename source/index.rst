**Content** The sound analysis of computational economic models requires expertise in economics, statistics, numerical methods, and software engineering. We equip students with fundamental skills in each of these areas.

**Learning outcome** We convey an appreciation for the challenges in the implementation and analysis of computational economic models and provide students an overview of different ways to address them.
